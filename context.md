**Use this context to generate all necessary components, pages, and backend logic for a modern online learning platform. Prioritize usability, fast onboarding, and a seamless course creation and learning experience. Remove all AI-powered course generation. Enable easy import/upload of course videos (YouTube or file upload) and ensure local payment options are supported if required. Only admins see admin content creation and management features.**
